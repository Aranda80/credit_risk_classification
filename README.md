# Credit Risk Classification

Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this application, we’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

## Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

## Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

## Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report



## Tecnologies required and installation guide:

* **imbalance-learn**

``` conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn```

* **PyDotPlus**

``` conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus ```


## Instructions

Use the `credit_risk_resampling.ipynb` notebook to visualize and analyze the performance of any ETF.

Note that this application requires the use of hvPlot for the visualizations.
